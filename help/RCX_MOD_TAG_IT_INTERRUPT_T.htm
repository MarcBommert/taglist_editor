<h2>Interrupt Settings</h2>

<p>
Configure here the settings for this module's interrupts. 
Using the Base parameter you can assign them to a specific
priority band; this is especially important if you plan
to use this module alongside another one which also uses
interrupts. In that case you need to decide which one gets
the higher priority.
</p>

<p>
If the Task Range parameter is non-zero, then this module
uses interrupts which execute as an rcX task. In this case
you need to configure the Task Priority and Token Base.
If the Task Range parameter is zero, the Task Priority and Token 
Base are ignored.
</p>

<p>
Note that, similar to the priority, each rcX task needs to
have a unique token. If you always use identical base values
for tokens and priorities, there should be no conflicts.
