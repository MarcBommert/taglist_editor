<h2>Interrupt Settings</h2>

<p>
This tag allows to configure the key settings of an individual interrupt.
Using the tag parameters, you can reassign the priority and token
parameters of a preconfigured interrupt. This feature is especially useful
when adapting a standard firmware for use with specific hardware.
</p>

<p>
If the interrupt executes as an rcX task, you must configure
the Task Priority and the Task Token. (These values have no
relevance for interrupts which do not execute as rcX tasks.)
Task priorities TSK_PRIO_1 and TSK_PRIO_2 should be reserved 
for tasks which are critical to the system.
Please consult the rcX Configuration and the Kernel API Function
Reference for more details about task priorities and tokens.
</p>

<p>
Recommendation: In order to avoid conflicts, always use identical
values for task priorities and for the associated task tokens.
