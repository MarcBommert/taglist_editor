<h2>Interrupt Group Settings</h2>

<p>
This tag allows to reconfigure the key settings of a group of interrupts.
Using the tag parameters, you can add a common base offset to the
priority and token entries of all interrupts within this group while
preserving their relative priorities. This feature is useful for
manipulating interrupts which have a close relationship.
</p>

<p>
E.g.: A firmware could use an interrupt group for adapting the interrupts
used for servicing a hardware interface with multiple ports.
</p>

<p>
The group may contain interrupts which execute as rcX tasks.
In this case you must configure the Task Priority Base
and the Task Token Base. (These values have no relevance
for interrupts which do not execute as rcX tasks.)
Task priorities TSK_PRIO_1 and TSK_PRIO_2 should be reserved 
for tasks which are critical to the system.
Please consult the rcX Configuration and the Kernel API Function
Reference for more details about task priorities and tokens.
</p>

<p>
Recommendation: In order to avoid conflicts, always use identical
values for task priorities and for the associated task tokens.

<tr>
    <td>Int. Priority Base</td>
    <td>
        Base value (= offset) added to the preconfigured interrupt priorities of all interrupts in the group. <br>
        Value range: 0 ... (32-Int. Priority Range), if the preconfigured task priorities are 0 ... (Int. Priority Range-1)
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Int. Priority Range</td>
    <td>
        Number of interrupts in the group. <br>
        This read-only parameter is useful when checking the allowed range for Int. Priority Base
        provided that the preconfigured interrupt priority values are 0 ... (Int. Priority Range-1).

<tr>
    <td>Task Priority Base</td>
    <td>
        Base value (= offset) added to the preconfigured task priorities of all interrupts in the group that execute as rcX tasks. <br>
        Value range: TSK_PRIO_1 .. TSK_PRIO_n, where n is 56-Task Range, if the preconfigured task priorities are 0 ... (Task Range-1)

    <td>
        Base value (= offset) added to the preconfigured task tokens of all interrupts in the group that execute as rcX tasks. <br>

<tr>
    <td>Task Range</td>
    <td>
        Number of interrupts in the group that execute in task mode. <br>
        This read-only parameter helps to calculate the allowed ranges for Task Priority Base and Task Token Base
        provided that the preconfigured task priority and task token values are 0 ... (Task Range-1).
    </td>

<tr>
    <td>Interrupt Group Ref.</td>
    <td>
        Group reference number common to all interrupts in the group. <br>
        This read-only parameter can be used to identify the interrupts belonging to the group.
