<h2>Custom Serial Flash Parameters</h2>

<p>
This tag allows you to override the built-in serial flash detection of the boot loader.<br>

Normally, the bootloader tries to detect the serial flash using a built-in list of serial flash types. 
If your flash is one of the built-in types, you do not need to use this tag.

When this tag is enabled, the bootloader will not go through the normal detection process. It will only try to detect the flash specified below.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
<b>About page erase/program commands:</b>
The flash must support the page-erase opcode or be able to perform a combined erase and program single page instruction.
The bootloader supports three ways to write a page on the flash, in the following order:
<ul>
	<li>page erase and program: erase and write a page in a single operation</li>
	<li>page erase + page program: erase a page, then write it</li>
	<li>page erase + fill buffer with data + write buffer to flash: erase a page, fill a buffer with new data, then write the buffer</li>
</ul>
This means that the flash must support the 'page erase and program' or the 'page erase' operation. 
In the second case, it must also support either 'page program' or 'fill buffer with data' and 'write buffer to flash'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Opcodes and command sequences:</b>Generally, an opcode or a command sequence length of 0 means that the operation is not supported by the chip or that the command should not be used.
</p>


<p>
<b>netX50 Fast Startup:</b> This tag does NOT re-configure the 4-bit access used in the netX 50 Fast startup mode.

                                                              This depends on the flash type, clock speed and the read command used.</td></tr>
