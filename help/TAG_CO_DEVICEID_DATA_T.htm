<h2>CANopen Product Information</h2>

<p>
The following parameters define a CANopen slave.
</p>
<p></p>

<table border=1>
<tr>
	<td>Vendor ID</td>
	<td>The Vendor ID is a unique number identifying 
		a registered company or a department of a registered company.
		The allocation of the Vendor ID is handled by CiA Headquarters.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Product Code</td>
	<td>The Product code identifies a specific device version. 
		It is assigned by the manufacturer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Revision </td>
	<td>The manufacturer-specific Revision number consists of a major revision 
		number (identifies a specific CANopen behavior) and a minor revision number 
		(identifies different versions of the same CANopen behavior). 
		If the CANopen functionality is expanded, the major revision number has 
		to be increased.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Device Profile Number and Additional Information </td>
	<td>These two parameters form the object Device Type (Object 1000h). 
		The Device Profile Number describes the profile that is used and the 
		Additional Information field provides information about optional 
		functionality of the device. 
		The Additional Information parameter is specified in the 
		appropriate device profile.
		Note: These two parameters are supported from CANopen stack 
		version 3 and higher. For earlier versions set Device Type to zero.
