<h2>LibStorage Position
</h2>

<p>
If a LibStorage partition is used, this tag can be used to specify the
offset and the size of the partition. 

The LibStorage position is not used within the 2nd Stage Boot Loader. 
The parameters are handed over to the firmware by using Boot Tokens.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The LibStorage partition has to be used in combination 
with the "Disk Position" and "Backup Partition" tags.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attention:</b> The Second Stage Boot Loader does not check for overlapping areas.<br>
Make sure the flash file system (disk position), backup partition and the LibStorage position do not overlap. Also, the last flash sector might be occupied by a Flash Device Label (FDL).
</p>

<table border=1>
<tr>
    <td>Offset</td>
    <td>
    The offset of the LibStorage partition from the beginning of the flash device in bytes.<br>
    The offset must be a multiple of the block/sector size of the used flash chip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Size</td>
    <td>The size of the LibStorage partition in bytes.<br>
    If set to 0, no LibStorage area is available.<br>
    The size must be a multiple of the block/sector size of the used flash chip.<br>
    The size includes two blocks/sectors which are reserved for the management area.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<b>Example:</b><br>
The Flash block size is 4096 Byte.<br>
The Offset is 0x20000, which is aligned to the used Flash block size.<br>
The remanent area size is defined with 14 Flash blocks.<br>
The management area needs 2 additional Flash blocks.<br>
Therefore the size for the LibStorage area has to be 16 * 4096 = 65536 bytes.<br>
