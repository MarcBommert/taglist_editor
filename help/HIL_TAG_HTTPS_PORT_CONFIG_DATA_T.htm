<h2>Web server (HTTPS) configuration</h2>

<p>
This tag configures web server's HTTPS related parameters.

<p></p>

<table border=1>
<tr>
	<td>Web server (HTTPS) Port Number </td>
	<td>The TCP port number used by the web server for HTTPS. <br>
	<br>
	The default value is 443.  <br>
	Range: 0 - 65535<br>
	<br>
	If the port number is set to 0, the web server will deactivate the HTTPS port.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Note:</b> Changing the port to a number that is already used by another component inside the firmware, <br>
	will lead to undefined firmware behavior and must be avoided (check the firmware's data sheet for already used TCP ports).

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Certificate Handling </td>
	<td>The Certificate Handling parameter defines the web server's behavior regarding the Security Configuration (Private Key, Default Certificate).<br>
    <ul>
		<li>0: Certificate and private key must be present in the Certificate Database, otherwise HTTPS won't start. </li>
		<li>1: Self signed certificate and private key will be generated by the web server itself, if any security configuration issue in the Certificate Database is detected during startup. </li>
		<li>2: Self signed certificate and private key will be generated by the web server itself, if no configuration within the Certificate Database is available. </li>
		<li>3-255: Reserved for future use. </li>
