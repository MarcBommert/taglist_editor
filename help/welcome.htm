<h2>Welcome to Tag List Editor.</h2>

<p>
The main purpose of this tool is to edit configuration tags used by netX option modules (NXO),
netX firmware files (NXF) or the 2nd Stage Loader. <br>


You can edit NXO, NXF or 2nd Stage Loader files, as well as raw tag list binaries.
Tag lists can be saved separately and loaded into another NXO/NXF/2nd stage loader file.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>
After starting the tool, or after clicking on "Empty NXO", an NXO file can be constructed
from its its components:
<ul>
  <li>a binary header file containing the common header, device info and module info headers</li>
  <li>an ELF file</li>
  <li>the tag list</li>
</ul>
  A command line script for this process is also included.
  It is also possible to load an existing NXO file and replace one or more of the components.
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>In order to parse an NXO/NXF/2nd Stage Loader, the file must contain a common header with at least version 3.</p>

<p>
The input routines refuse any input outside the allowed range for a field, with one exception: 
They will not prevent you from entering the value 0, since hex numbers always start with this digit.
If you have loaded a tag list containing incorrect values and want to edit such a value, mark it and
press backspace, then enter a correct value.</p>
