<h2>Welcome to Tag List Editor.</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this tool is to view and edit the configuration of netX firmware files.<br>
This is done by editing a list of data structures included in the firmware binary, called the "Tag list", 
and the device info header.<br>

In this context, "firmware" refers to netX firmware files in NXF, NXI/NXE, MXF or NAI/NAE format,
netX option modules (NXO) and 2nd Stage loader binaries.<br>

It is also possible to edit raw tag list binaries. 
Tag lists can be saved separately and loaded into another file.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>
In order to load a firmware file, use the "Load" button right to the "NXO/NXF/NXI/MXF/NAI" label.
</p>

<p>
After start, or after clicking the "Clear" button, the Tag List Editor is set up for constructing
an option module (NXO) file from components:
<ul>
  <li>a binary header file containing the common header, device info and module info headers</li>
  <li>an ELF file</li>
  <li>the tag list</li>
</ul>
  A command line script for this process is also included.
  It is possible to load an existing NXO file and replace its components.
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>This editor can only open firmware files containing a common header with at least version 3.</p>

<p>
The input routines refuse any input outside the allowed range for a field, with one exception: 
They will not prevent you from entering the value 0, since hex numbers always start with this digit.
If you have loaded a tag list containing incorrect values and want to edit such a value, mark it and
press backspace, then enter a correct value.</p>
