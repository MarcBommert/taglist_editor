<h2>Task Group Settings</h2>

<p>A task group is a set of related tasks which operate within
one dedicated priority range. A module can use different 
task groups, for instance to have critical functionality
run in a high priority band, while other less critical routines 
execute on a lower priority.
</p>

<p>
Note that, similar to the priority, each rcX task needs to
have a unique token. If you always use identical base values
for tokens and priorities, there should be no conflicts.
</p>

<p>
Please consult the rcX Configuration and the Kernel API Function
Reference for more details about task priorities and tokens.
