<h2>TCP Port Numbers</h2>

<p>
This tag is used to specify whether incoming TCP/UDP frames are handled by the TCP/IP stack or the Ethernet Interface module.<br>

Usually, unless the Ethernet Interface module is used, the TCP/IP stack handles all incoming TCP/UDP frames by itself.
If the Ethernet Interface module is used, the destination port number of a frame determines whether it is handled by the
TCP/IP stack or forwarded to the Ethernet Interface module.<br>

This tag defines the ports which are to be handled by the TCP/IP stack. It specifies a range of ports and a list of additional port numbers.

<table border=1>
<tr>
	<td>TCP/UDP Port Range (First Port)</td>
	<td>The first port of the TCP/UDP-Port range. The minimum value is 1024.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>TCP/UDP Port Range (Last Port)</td>
	<td>The last port of the TCP/UDP-Port range. The range must contain at least 1024 ports, i.e. last port - first port &gt;= 1023.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Number of Protocol Stack Ports</td>
	<td>This is the number of entries from the beginning of the port list which are used by the the protocol stack. <br>
	 These entries are required by the protocol stack. They are shown for information only and must not be changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Number of Additional Ports</td>
	<td>This is the number of valid entries which have been added by the user. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Port 1 <br> .. <br> Port 20</td>
	<td>A list of port numbers, interpreted according to "Number of Protocol Stack Ports" and "Number of Additional Ports". <br>
		<b>Example: </b><br> 
		"Number of Protocol Stack Ports" is 5 and "Number of Additional Ports" is 2.<br>
		Entries 1 - 5 are predefined by the protocol and must not be changed.<br>
		Entries 6 and 7 have been added by the user. <br>
		Entries 8 - 20 are ignored.
