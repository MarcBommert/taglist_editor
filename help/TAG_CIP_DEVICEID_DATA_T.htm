<h2>CIP Product Information</h2>

<p>
The following parameters define a CIP device (Ethernet/IP, DeviceNet, CompoNet).
Except for 'Product Name', all of these parameters are used by a connection 
originator to identify the device with certainty. 
The parameters shall match the values defined in the corresponding EDS file.
</p>
<p></p>

<table border=1>
<tr>
	<td>Vendor ID</td>
	<td>Defines the vendor of the device. Vendor IDs are managed by ODVA. <br>
	The value of zero is not valid.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Device Type</td>
	<td>The Device Type is used to identify the device profile that the product 
		is using. 
		Device profiles define minimum requirements a device must implement 
		as well as common options. 
		The list of device types is managed by ODVA.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Product Code</td>
	<td>The Product Code identifies a product within a device type. 
		It is assigned by the vendor. <br>
		The value zero is not valid.<br>
		<p>Typically, the Product Code maps to one or more catalog/model numbers.
		Products shall have different codes if 
		their configuration and/or runtime options are different. 
		Such devices present a different logical view to the network.
		On the other hand for example, two products that are the same except 
		for their color or mounting feet are the same logically and may share 
		the same product code.</p>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Revision </td>
	<td>The Revision, which consists of Major and Minor Revisions, identifies 
		the Revision of the item the Identity Object is representing.<br> 
		The value zero is not valid for either the Major and Minor Revision fields.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Product Name</td>
	<td>This text string should contain a short description of the 
		product/product family represented by the Product Code. 
		The same Product Code may have a variety of product name strings. <br>
		The maximum number of characters in this string is 32.</td>
