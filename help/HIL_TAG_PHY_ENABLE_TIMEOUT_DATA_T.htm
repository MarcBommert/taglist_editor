<h2>Phy enable timeout after firmware startup</h2>

<p>
  With this tag, you can set the timeout to enable the Phys after firmware startup.
  If no Phy configuration is provided to main protocol stack integrated in the firmware
  up to this timeout, all Phys will be enabled with default settings.
  The default settings are Autonegotiation and Autocrossover.
</p>

<p>
  If the main protocol stack gets its valid Phy configuration prior the timeout hits,
  the Phys will be configured with the parameters from configuration.
  If the main protocol stack gets its valid Phy configuration after the timeout hits,
  the protocol stack will reparameterize the Phys according to its configuration.
  This may lead to short link loss in case the configuration is different to defaults.
</p>

<p>
  By default (if taglist is unchanged) the Phy enable timeout is inactive and set to 0.
  In this case the Phy is not switched on by the firmware and a valid Phy
  configuration of the protocol stack is needed.
  If the timeout is set to a value greater than 0, the firmware will check the Phys
  state after the given timeout. If Phys are not configured, they will be enabled.
</p>
