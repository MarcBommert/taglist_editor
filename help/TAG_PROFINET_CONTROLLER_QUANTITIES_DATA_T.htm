<h2>PROFINET Controller Settings</h2>

<p>
In this tag, you can enable, disable or configure some PROFINET features.<br>
<b>Note:</b> Due to available memory resources, restrictions apply regarding the possible combinations of the features. 
It is not possible to max out all quantity structures in parallel.

<table border=1>

<tr>
	<td>Number of IO Connections (ARs)</td>
	<td>
	The number of cyclic PROFINET IO connections supported by the firmware. 
	Configurations containing more configured ARs will be rejected.<br>
	Allowed values are 1 - 128.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Number of parallel DeviceAccess ARs</td>
	<td>
	The amount of supported DeviceAccess ARs. <br>
	Allowed values are 0 - 1.<br>
	0 means DeviceAccess AR is not supported.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Number of submodules</td>
	<td>
	The amount of submodules supported by the firmware (sum of all submodules of all IO ARs).
    Configurations containing more submodules will be rejected.<br>
	Allowed values are 32 - 2048.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>GSD parameter record storage size</td>
	<td>
	The available memory for storing GSD record parameters in KB. <br>
	Each IO AR  has its own storage of this size.<br>
    Configurations containing a more GSD parameters per IO AR will be rejected.<br>
	Allowed values are 4 - 256. The Profinet Specification requires a minimum value of 16.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Number of ARVendorBlocks</td>
	<td>
	The amount of ARVendorBlocks supported by the firmware (sum of all ARVendorBlocks of all IO ARs).
    Configurations containing more ARVendorBlocks will be rejected.<br>
	Allowed values are 1 - 512.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>ARVendorBlock storage size</td>
	<td>
	The supported size per ARVendorBlock supported by the firmware.
    Configurations containing larger ARVendorBlocks will be rejected.<br>
	Allowed values are 128 - 4096.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Size for acyclic application Read/Write requests</td>
	<td>
	The firmware offers one large buffer for runtime Read/Write requests. 
    The size of this buffer in KB is set here.<br>
    Allowed values are 4 - 256. <br>
    Note that per IO AR an additional (small) buffer for parallel Read/Write requests exists. Their size can not be modified.
