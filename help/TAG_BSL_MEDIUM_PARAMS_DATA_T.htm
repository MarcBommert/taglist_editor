<h2>Destination Media for Flashing</h2>

<p>
If enabled, the 2nd Stage Loader will be flashed if it was loaded via DPM/PCI or serial console, so it will always be available during startup.
It is possible to override the default volume being used.

		<li>If the BSL was loaded via PCI/DPM and not flashed, use a RAM disk.</li>
		<li>If the BSL was loaded from parallel flash, don't use any file system, but use an NXF file at 0xc0040000.</li>
