Using this tag, it is possible to override the default device being used for the volume, and to enable automatic flashing of the
bootloader.

    If this flag is enabled and the 2nd Stage Loader is downloaded via DPM/PCI or the serial console, it will flash itself
    to the destination device.

    <ul>
        <li>Auto-detect media: See below</li>
        <li>RAM Disk: Use a file system in RAM</li>
        <li>Serial Flash: Use a file system in serial flash</li>
        <li>Parallel Flash: No file system will be available.
            Only a single file can be downloaded and will always be stored at location 0xc0040000.</li>
        <li>SQI Flash: Use a file system in flash for configuration files.
            Only a single firmware file can be downloaded and will always be stored at location 0x09020000.
            (The first 128 KB of the SQI flash device are reserved for the Second Stage Loader.)
            The flash file system starts at location 0x09200000 and occupies the remaining 2 MB.
            This setting allows for a maximum firmware file size of 1,875 MB (0x001E0000).</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    Auto-detection works as follows:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>If the BSL is running from serial flash, use serial flash.</li>
        <li>If the BSL was loaded via PCI/DPM and self-flashing is disabled, use a RAM disk.</li>
        <li>If the BSL was loaded from parallel flash, use parallel flash.</li>
        </ul>
