<h2>Task Group Settings</h2>

<p>
This tag allows to reconfigure the key settings of a group of tasks.
Using the tag parameters, you can add a common base offset to the
priority and token entries of all tasks within this group while
preserving their relative priorities. This feature is useful for
manipulating tasks which have a close relationship.
</p>

<p>
E.g.: A firmware could use different task groups for tasks with
critical functionality running in a high priority band and for
other tasks with less critical functionality running in a lower
priority band.
</p>

<p>
Please note that each rcX task needs to have a unique token and
a unique priority. Recommendation: In order to avoid conflicts,
always use identical values for task priorities and for the
associated task tokens.
</p>

<p>
Task priorities TSK_PRIO_1 and TSK_PRIO_2 should be reserved 
for tasks which are critical to the system.
Please consult the rcX Configuration and the Kernel API Function
Reference for more details about task priorities and tokens.

        Number of tasks in the group. <br>
        This read-only parameter is useful when checking the allowed range for Base Priority and Base Token.

    <td>Task Group Ref.</td>
    <td>
        Group reference number common to all tasks in the group. <br>
        This read-only parameter can be used to identify the tasks belonging to the group.
