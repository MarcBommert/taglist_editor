<h2>DDP Mode after firmware startup</h2>

<p>
With this tag, you can control the DDP mode on firmware startup.
The DDP is integrated in the firmware operating system.
The DDP offers two modes: "active" or "passive" mode.
This influences the possibilities of your application in regards of the usage
of the DDP Set API to modify parameter in DDP.
</p>

<p>
In "passive" mode the usage of the DDP Set API is possible (for writable
parameters). The firmware will treat the writable DDP parameters as invalid
(with all corresponding consequences) until the application informs the firmware
that DDP parameters are now valid.
The application is required to use the DDP API to set DDP mode to "active" later.
Consequences of "passive" DDP mode (incomplete list)
<ul>
<li>protocol specific configuration is rejected</li>
<li>NDIS is not working</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In "active" mode the usage of DDP Set API is not possible and will be rejected.
The firmware will directly use and activate the DDP parameters (which are
typically contained in FDL).
</p>

<p>
By default (if taglist is unchanged) the DDP starts in "active" more.
In consequence, no DDP parameter can be changed with DDP Set API.
